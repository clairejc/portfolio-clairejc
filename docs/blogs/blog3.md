# Lecture 15 Design That Matters
I really enjoyed Lyle’s talk on Wednesday surrounding the conversation of creating a company that truly cares and a company that prioritizes all of their stakeholders. 

To me, when the conversation of a company genuinely caring for all its stakeholders, I start to think of ethics. Oftentimes, when companies focus on fast growth, it’s easy to lose sight of their ethical values. Therefore, it’s really important that companies to commit to ethical practices that respect not just their main shareholders who hold the most power, but also employees, customers, and the broader community. This process proves difficult for many companies due to imbalances in power and wants, so it is continuously a push and pull situation.

Some of the biggest, most successful tech companies with so many resources and financial backing often deprioritize certain stakeholders. For example, factory workers and supply chain labor are essential to production but may face low wages and poor conditions as companies cut costs to raise their profit even more. 

Consumers, as primary stakeholders, can also be affected by these ethical compromises, mostly through concerns over privacy and data usage. 

As companies grow, the pressure to maximize profits can tempt them to cut corners ethically. Prioritizing short term gains over long term values brings up an important question to consider: How can companies stay true to their ethics while pushing for growth?

A solution could be embedding ethics into the company’s foundation upon its creation. Establishing strong foundational structures that constantly support ethical decisions, promoting transparency, and regularly assessing company practices can keep companies accountable from top to down across stakeholders through a series of checks and balances. By building a company culture that values ethical principles from the start, companies can stay on track toward sustainable success and maintain prioritization across their stakeholders.
