# Lecture 15 Design That Matters

Thanks for sharing this post! I really resonate with your point about companies misusing status markers like B-corp and PBC certifications. The fact that so much of the B-corp process relies on self-reporting really does leave a lot of space for companies to bend the narrative to their benefit. It’s frustrating because, as you mentioned, it creates this “muddied” ethical space where we as consumers are left second guessing our decisions.

I also thought your example of the fashion world was spot on. The industry is known for their constant mixed messaging, where so-called "sustainable" brands often have just as many hidden layers of waste or unethical practices. It’s disappointing as a consumer , especially for those of us who want to shop more responsibly but feel like we have to do an investigation just to buy a t-shirt.

Your mention of Wren as a positive example of transparency is similar to what I was thinking about in my blog past as well. It brings us to ask the question how just how important transparency is and how much of an impact can it have? When companies are upfront about their structure and finances, like Wren is with their CEO’s salary, it feels like they’re welcoming accountability. 
How much could this transparency inspire other companies new and old to start doing the same? What do you think could be done to make this type of transparency more mainstream and widespread longterm?
