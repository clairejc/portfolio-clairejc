# Project Pitches Blog 

I really enjoyed HARV-it’s project pitch and felt that the team conducted a thorough series of research and categorization to arrive at their project idea and presentation. The Fam.ly concept is innovative and addresses a genuine need for this generation by fostering deeper, more meaningful connections during an era where digital communication is rapidly expanding.

I really enjoyed the diagrams included in the pitch, which helped the audience visualize the three core areas and functionalities—chat-based communication, archiving, and prompt-specific features—that the app aims to combine. These visuals really effectively depicted the app’s purpose and design.

I also had a few questions after the presentation:

- Fam.ly seems to be primarily a social media app. What makes Fam.ly unique enough to consistently attract users away from other platforms they are already familiar with? For example, in an earlier class assignment, I interviewed someone about their favorite social media app. They said WeChat and explained that it satisfies all their needs within a single platform. How does Fam.ly plan to incentivize users to pull away from those other apps in such a competitive market?
- I think incorporating some form of gamification could be a valuable addition. Since a key goal of the app is to maintain a dynamic and evolving memory archive, it’s crucial to incentivize users to consistently contribute and engage with the platform. Could gamification or a reward system be used to encourage regular use and active participation?

Overall, HARV-it’s pitch was really captivating and interesting, and the app concept shows a lot of potential!
