# Lecture 13 Blog Post


After Monday’s lecture, I spent some time reflecting on the various methodologies we discussed for evaluating user interface (UI) design, particularly heuristic evaluations and cognitive walkthroughs.

I mainly wanted to focus on the cognitive walkthrough approach to evaluating UI. From the lecture, I learned that this approach primarily focuses on understanding the user’s thought process during interactions with the UI. This technique examines the gaps between what users intend to do and how they perceive the actions available to them. We went over the Bank of America ATM example during class, and I wanted to explore how a cognitive walkthrough could differ when the target audience consists of people from different age groups.

I wanted to consider this because the app I’m working on targets an older audience while also accommodating a younger demographic. I aimed to see how conducting cognitive walkthroughs with different age groups could reveal potential age biases in app creation. Ultimately, I hope to use this knowledge to provide the best user experience across age groups in my app.

Overall, this paper examined two e-commerce websites, Amazon.com and Alibaba.com. For older individuals, while browsing what is on offer, they often find themselves needing “help to search for suitable products and complete an order.” They struggle to interpret a lot of information presented about a product, such as minimum order limitations on Alibaba.com. It seemed that their technical proficiency and agility with app usage limited what elderly users could do on the app.

Ultimately, through the cognitive walkthroughs performed on the two sites, a conclusion was drawn that elderly users suffer the most from age bias across e-commerce applications. They often find themselves stuck in situations where the items displayed to them aren’t suitable, or they do not know exactly how to navigate the page. In those moments, there isn’t much aid or instruction available, leading them to abandon their interaction with the app.

After reflecting on the class material as well as this paper, I realized that I should focus on ensuring the app navigation process is understandable and not overwhelming for the elderly audience.
