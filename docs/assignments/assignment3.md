Concepts currently address and explore functionalities of the main features.

## User:

### Purpose: 
Provide authentication for users, ensuring secure access to their accounts.

#### Operational principle: 
After a user (person or org) registers with a phone number and password valid ID, they can then person_login or org_login by entering the associated username and password

### Actions:

Returns a user that has valid name, phone number, password, ID just registered.

#### user_login(number: Integer, password: String, out user: User): 
Returns a registered user that correctly corresponds with the number and password provided.

user_number: User -> one Integer

user_password: User -> one String

user_id: User -> one user_ID


## Org
### Purpose: 
Provide authentication for organizations, ensuring secure access to their accounts.

### Operational principle: 
After a organization registers with an email, password, and valid organization ID, they can then org_login by entering the associated username and password.

## 2.2 CONCEPT SYNCS
### 2.2.a
Syncing when a like/message is sent from a user, the like/message request shows up in the inbox of the receiving user. 

```
sync addLikeInbox(from: User, to: User):
	when FriendshipRequest.send_like(from, to):
		FriendshipInbox.add_request(from, to) //add from like request to the to inbox
```
```
sync addMessageInbox(from: User, to: User, message: String):
	when FriendshipRequest.send_message(from, to, String):
		FriendshipInbox.add_request(from, to) //add from message request & contents to inbox.
```
	
### 2.2.b
Syncing when an event is removed from Organization Events, the reservation/waitlist events of a user are updated and the events are refiltered according to user preferences.

```
sync eventRemoval(event: Event):
	when OrgEvent.remove_event(event):
        //loop through all users in event and update for all users.
		EventSignUp.remove_res(user, event) 
		EventFiltering.filter_events(user, user_preferences: list Preference, events: list Event)
```

### 2.2.c
Syncing when an event is added to Organizaion Events, the events are refiltered according to user preferences.

```
sync eventAddition(event: Event, events: list Event):
	when OrgEvent.add_event(event):
        //loop through all users in event and update for all users
		EventFiltering.filter_events(user, user_preferences: list Preference, events: list Event)
```

### 2.2.d
Syncing when in settings, the instructions_on setting is turned on, the instructions will begin starting once we exit settings and reach the home page. Even when instructions_on setting is turned off, when the instructions button is pressed on any page, this will be synced to Instructions.start_instruct for that page.

```
sync instructionsOn():
    when Settings.instructions_on(on=true):
        Instructions.start_instruct(page=home_page)
```

# 4. DESIGN TRADEOFFS

## Design Tradeoff: Visual Display

### Options
#### Visual Simplicity: 
Ensure that there is a minimalistic design with a simple, neutral palette and a clean layout. Maintain a consistent design throughout all pages to help users become familiar with the app.

#### Ease of Understanding: 
Include easily recognizable icons as well as concise yet meaningful text that makes navigating each page clear and understandable. Use different, more vibrant colors to quickly identify and differentiate between buttons and functions to avoid confusion.

### Rationale
A design that prioritizes ease of understanding was chosen to help users, especially the elderly, better recognize and understand the different features and functionalities of the app. The app has many features, so although it is important for pages to be relatively simple, this cannot be guaranteed. Therefore, for features such as the Friendship Hub or News Feed, I have prioritized helping users easily understand what the functionalities on each page are and where they are located. This can aid users in being able to more independently reach their end goal on the app.

## Design Tradeoff: News Feed Feature

### Issues with feature inclusion
#### Time constraint: 
With two of the larger featuresâ€”Friendship Hub and Organization Eventâ€”at play, implementing a third relatively complex feature would be difficult given the four-week time constraint.

#### Licensing/regulations: 
Grabbing news from outside sources requires certain agreements or licensing that may be extensive or complex. 

#### Scalability:
Managing the storage news content especially if rich media such as videos or high-res images could be difficult to deal with.


### Options
#### Part of expansion feature in the future:
Maintain the app primarily as a socializing and connection tool, and include the news feature in the future when adding the more information-based aspect of social media.

#### Direct user to sites or links:
Instead of actually having news in the app, offer links with short descriptions of the articles to take the user out of the app.


### Rationale
Prioritizing the main features upon the initial rollout of the app would help provide a social experience that is helpful and beneficial for elders. Once users feel that they would like to spend more time on this app and are accustomed to the existing features, the news feed feature can be launched slightly later. The complexities of navigating information licensing or including pop-out tabs and links in the existing interface could be overwhelming for the user and technically challenging to implement within the current timeframe.

## Design Tradeoff: Types of Users
### Options
#### Non-elderly, elderly
Originally, I planned to do just user sign-ups, where users would be divided into non-elderly and elderly subgroups. Through their identification, they would have profiles with features allotted to their specific groups: the elderly would have access to all features, while the non-elderly would have access to direct messaging and group messaging. Organizations would contact the app creators/managers and have their events posted by individuals on the backend.

#### Non-elderly, elderly, organizations
With organizations added, there would be the option of registering as a user or an organization. With this differentiation, the steps of signing up and validation are different, as described in the User and Org concepts. Users will see certain features of the app, and organizations will be able to add their events to the organization events tab for users to sign up for.

### Rationale
I decided to include non-elderly, elderly, and organizations as the groups that can create accounts on the app. Although both options would require approval from the app creators for events submitted by organizations, including organizations as part of the sign-up process (1) allows organizers to keep track of their event sign-ups through the app. This also (2) eliminates the extra step of the app backend having to convert an event to a valid format for display:

Option 1: Organization submits events through email/form â†’ App backend processes event validity â†’ App backend converts event to valid format for app â†’ Event appears in app.

Option 2: Organization submits events through app â†’ App backend processes event validity â†’ Event appears in app.
