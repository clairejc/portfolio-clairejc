## AARP interface
AARP's overall interface has very simple layout with icons along with simple labels that are easily understandable for its more elderly audience. Could be good to take inspiration from this for simple yet understandable pages.

# 4. VSD ANALYSIS

## 4.1 Stakeholders: 
### Observation: 
It is important that this app focuses on serving it's target stakeholders, the elders. While focusing on this, it is important for those close with elders to feel that using this apps is beneficial and helpful and be able to reflect their opinions.

### Design response:
We can potentially include a feedback tab for users to document their user experience both for elders and their close ones, so we can better understand if we're satisfying the communication needs of all parties while allowing the elderly to use social media more independently and smoothly.

## 4.2 Stakeholders:
### Observation:

This app is targeted towards the elderly, and oftentime they may require extra accessibility accomodations, yet may feel overwhelmed if they need to deal with toggling too many settings upon setup. 

### Design response:
To further help elders find ease in using this app, we could conduct a concise and comprehensive survey upon signing up for the app that includes a series of questions tailored towards certain setting options. The responses to this survey can then be used to create a preset for items such as font size, colors, instruction repetition. 

## 4.3 Pervasiveness:
### Observation:
Current features that are only open to elderly include the friendship hub and organization participation. Other than chat features and potentially news, there aren't that many features for those close to the elderly.

### Design response:
In order to potentially increase the incentive for using the app, as well as feeling involved with the app perhaps some organization participation can be opened to non-elders for volunteering/larger community.


## 4.4 Values
### Observation:
It is important for the elders to not feel overwhelmed with each page of the app or the amount and types of information they are receiving. 

### Design Response:
To combat this, it could be good allow the users to select tags and filter in all the areas of news, friendship hub, and organization participation. Potentially, I can also include a support feature to allow users to set a limit the amount of swipes allowed per day, articles to read, organization event visible on a page to allow more autonomy for information reception. 


## 4.5 Time
### Observation: 
Overtime the elderly may find that they do not want to participate in certain features for a period of time or their accessibility needs for the app change.

### Design Response:
It could be helpful to include a reset settings button/retake questionaire for the accessibility settings to be reset/readjusted. Also, I could consider including the option of temporarily pausing friendship hub accounts and allowing deletion of registered accounts completely.

# 5. STORYBOARDING/SKETCHING
## User requesting additional instruction for adjusting settings
![](instructionsrequest.png){:width='1000'}

Future decisions:
1. Other settings to include.
2. Format of return to homepage button/function.
3. Incorporate instructions in a noncluttered way.


## Finding friends on Friendship Hub

Future decisions:
