# 1. PREPARATION
## 1.1 Hunch
Can a singular social media app truly serve the wants and needs of all different generations? With so many apps constantly being developed for the newer generations, would the older generations/elderly benefit from an app designed specifically for them?

## 1.2 Who to interview?
Social media is said to have started with inventions in the mid-1990s, meaning several generations of individuals in today's world lived more than half their life without using social media in their day to day lives. I would like to interview two individuals from different generations who have been exposed to social media in very different stages of their life. I have created two categories to choose my two interviewees from:

(1) "Pre social media". Introduced to social media after their childhood, well into their working years, and potentially after retirement. 

(2) "Post social media". Born with social media already existing. Have not experienced life without the existence of social media platforms.

## Interviewee Selection:
### YEMEI - "Pre social media"
YEMEI is in her 80s, and lived most of her life in southern China. She lived in a farming village until her 30s, and moved into the city of Guangzhou for the next 20 years of her life. She has now relocated to the United States to live closer to her children.

### JESSE - "Post social media"
Jesse is in his 20s and lived in US suburbia up until college. He recently graduated from university and is working as a Software Engineer in New York City. He is a heavy user of many social media apps with multiple accounts on some. 

### Selection Reasoning
I chose Jesse somewhat as a "control" to get a gauge of how a working individual who has had access to social media their entire feels about social media. I plan to ask him questions about how his view on and perception of social media is currently and how it has changed throughout the years. I chose Yemei as my interviewee who will represent the potential target demographic of elderly individuals who use social media. I hope to use this interview as an opportunity to understand her perspective and identify potential core differences between the younger and older generations of social media users. Throughout the interview, I hope to be able to better understand the social media needs of the elderly in contrast to the younger generations, as well as pinpoint some key opportunities of an app design that could in some way satisfy these needs.

### Yemei Interview Report


Throughout my conversation with Yemei, I realized that the older generation finds it challenging to keep up with the many social media apps and in-app functionalities and resources in today's world. Her responses shed light on the lack of comfortability and savviness that the older generation may feel in contrast to younger generations in social media use, leading to an implication that the older generation could benefit from a more tailored app to accommodate their needs.

Upon initial conversation, Yemei disclosed that she only uses one social media app, WeChat. The reason for her initial use of WeChat is that many of her family members were using it and "set up an account for me[her] and added me to the group chats with other family." This indicates that her social media usage began with great influence and guidance from her family members. Yemei's responses demonstrate that it is highly important for elderly like Yemei to feel connected to her family and friends by being able to text, call, and see them. She also considers it important to stay updated on societal events, yet finds that "sometimes I [she] sees too much stuff at once or receives too much information that I [she] didn't ask for and feel[s] overwhelmed." After asking Yemei about her comfort with social media apps, I noted that she brings up "my son helped set me up with..." and considers some apps and features as "too hard to deal with" multiple times. She's attempted to use other social media apps before but found it overwhelming and hard to get used to the large amount of people in the meeting room. She recalls that "the process of having to mute and unmute as well as react in live time felt very stressful to me" This reaction demonstrates the lack of comfortability that many elderly people may share when it comes to navigating robust social media networks with many functionalities. Many of them like Yemei, who use WeChat for the calling and messaging features,  need or utilize a few features within a small number of apps. Yemei recalls her ways of communication before social media - phone calls and meeting up in person - and heavily prefers having access to social media as it "makes everything and everyone more accessible even if they are in a different country". This poses the issue that although elders enjoy the accessibility and resources that social media provides, they oftentimes find it difficult to independently and extensively utilize many existing social media.




## 2.2 Post social media: Jesse

### Jesse Interview Report


Jesse has utilized many types of social media for different purposes growing up and currently uses around 10 social media apps on the day-to-day. Across his social media platforms, he is connected with a wide range of individuals from many different facets of his life. While speaking about his comfortability with social media, he recalls that he "grew up playing a lot of games with friends throughout primary and secondary school and feel[s] like there are so many more features on these video games than any social media platform that I [he] used. So this makes social media generally pretty intuitive...". Since he has repeated the learning process for many online platforms multiple times, the act of doing so has become natural to him. Although he doesn't find many challenges in using social media, many of his responses seem to lead to the idea that an excessive number of social media apps/features isn't that necessary at the end of the day.


It was an "aha" moment in forming some of my design direction when he said that he uses his preferred social media, Instagram, and many others, "out of want. I think if it came down to it, I would be happy using just iMessage to text and make plans to hang out in person and maybe Instagram sometimes for niche content." This comment made me realize that in all honesty a lot of features that social media provides are somewhat supplemental to all individuals' lives. At the core, many individuals find a lot of appreciation a relatively simple app that can allow them to stay connected and communicate with their close friends and family. Over the years, Jesse's reasons for using social media have shifted from having a means of chatting and socializing to feeling the need to be updated on what acquaintances, friends, and influencers are up to, to ultimately spending more time delving into content that genuinely interests him. He states that this preference shift comes from the desire to "focus more on interacting with his closer circle of family and friends and prioritize the time he spends consuming meaningful content." He confirmed my inkling that many people social media out of want over need. Thus, social media savvy individuals could ultimately find themselves somewhat overloaded with an unnecessary amount of social media usage. 


## Interview Conclusions -> Design Opportunities
Different generations of individuals who use some form of social media seem to have a tangible difference in their ability and capacity to use social media. Many younger individuals find themselves to have much more capacity to use and learn more social media apps that they find interesting, whereas it is more difficult for the older generations. Elders also seem to find themselves using social media as a way of (1) staying connected with family and friends (2) learning new information about society. Yet sometimes, they can find features of existing apps somewhat unnecessary or difficult to navigate through. Increased overstimulation and inability to distinguish between truth and fabrication are also more prominent in elders than in the younger generation. Since the younger generation is able to catch on to new social media faster, it could benefit everyone if the elders could have a social media app that they can feel comfortable with. This app can be designed to feel accessible to the elderly which helps them stay socially connected and intellectually stimulated.

# 3. Design Opportunities

## 1. Clean and concise user environment
Ensure that UI-wise, each page of the app is relatively minimalistic and limits the clutter to the eyes to decrease the possibility of feeling overwhelmed. Oftentimes not only for elderly but for the normal social media user, ads and popups may be distracting, overstimulating, bothersome. They could be even more so to the elderly, so actively choosing to not including distracting functionalities could aid in the user experience.


## 2. Accessible
Work to accommodate the needs of the elderly who could have visual, hearing, or other impairments by having easily accessible font size changes, closed captioning, understandable icons, etc. Could be helpful to include further assistive tools that can allow the elderly to use and learn to use the app more independently through in-app resources such as repetitive (self-defined) easy-to-understand explanations to feature use.

## 3. Online to offline
Socialization with family and friends both online and in person is important for the elderly. Group chat, solo chat -friendly as well as incorporating tools that can promote elderly individuals forming social groups/friendships online that can be taken offline. Facilitate features to allow the elderly to find friends with similar interests and hobbies around them to encourage socialization.


## 4. Information filtering capabilities
It is difficult to prevent oneself from trusting everything seen on social media. There is potential in a news reading/audio/video feature where the elderly can choose to have the news and information they receive be preprocessed in a way that they only receive information in a certain niche or from certain sources. This can potentially decrease the amount of excessive/unwanted exposure that could be uncalled for or overwhelming when provided at random.
